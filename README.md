# AutomatKomorkowy
Automat Komorkowy - is a system consisting of single cells. These cells are next to each other, reminding
you with a chessboard or board. Each cell of the machine can be in one of the states, the number of such
states being finite and arbitrarily large. The state of the cell is changed according to the rules of how the new
state of the cell depends on its current state and the state of its neighbors, ie other cells in its vicinity.
